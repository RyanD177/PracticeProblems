Write a memoize function that takes in a required callbackk function
 and a optional resolver function. mem should return a memoized version of the callback function
the callback function defined as :
all return values of the memoized function are cached
if the memoized callback is called with an existing cache key, the key should be returned WITHOUT invoking the callback again
memozied function should also have three methods:
clear: clears out the cache.
delete: delete the cache entry correspoing to the passed arguments if one exists.
has: returns a boolean of true if the cache hs an entry corresponding to the passed arugments, otherwise false.

assume the callback doesnt reference this.
